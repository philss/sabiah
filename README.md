This is the code for the presentation I did in Ruby Conf BR 2016.
It's a MVP of something similar to Twitter. It's written using Phoenix and Vue.js

## Running

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
