This is the code for the presentation I gave at [Ruby Conf BR 2016](http://www.rubyconf.com.br/) and also at the [ElugSP #7](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/elug_sp/events/234642921/).

It's a MVP of something similar to Twitter. It's written using Phoenix and Vue.js.

You can find the slides at [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/philss/um-clone-do-twitter-com-phoenix-e-vue-dot-js) (in Portuguese).

## Running

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
